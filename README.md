# Classification

This time, I will attempt to develop a classification model that can categorize targets using available features. I utilized multiple datasets sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, such as Raisin and Car Evaluation. I conducted classification tasks on both datasets and determined the most appropriate algorithm for each based on achieving the highest accuracy score. For specifics regarding each algorithm and dataset, please refer to the provided directory.
